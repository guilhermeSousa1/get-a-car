## What is this 🤷‍♂️

I have been working with Angular for one year at [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/). In that time, I have developed and worked on some great web applications, but all of them are internal apps that
I can't show.

This is a showcase application that I've built in my spare time using some of the more modern technologies now being adopted in the Angular ecosystem.

## Tech stack 👨‍💻

## Unit/Integration tests 🧪

All of the application components, services, pipes, validators, interceptors, etc., are fully tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Code coverage is sitting at **94%**.

## Setting up the development environment 🛠
